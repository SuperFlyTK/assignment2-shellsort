# Shell Sort Implementation

An optimized and well-documented implementation of the **Shell Sort** algorithm â€” an improved version of Insertion Sort that sorts elements with decreasing gap intervals, resulting in significantly better performance on large datasets.

---

## Algorithm Overview

**Shell Sort** improves upon **Insertion Sort** by allowing exchanges of far-apart elements.
It starts with a large gap between elements, sorting sublists of elements spaced by that gap.
As the algorithm progresses, the gap is reduced until it becomes 1 â€” effectively performing a final Insertion Sort pass on a nearly sorted array.

This reduces the total number of shifts required and increases sorting efficiency.

## Complexity Analysis

| Case                 | Time Complexity         | Description                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Best Case**        | O(n log n)              | When the array is nearly sorted |
| **Average Case**     | O(n^(3/2)) â€“ O(n^(4/3)) | Depends on the gap sequence     |
| **Worst Case**       | O(nÂ²)                   | For poorly chosen gap sequences |
| **Space Complexity** | O(1)                    | In-place sorting algorithm      |

### Gap Sequences Comparison

| Sequence Type            | Formula / Pattern   | Worst-Case Complexity |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Shell's Original**     | n/2, n/4, n/8, ...  | O(nÂ²)                 |
| **Knuth's Sequence**     | (3^k - 1) / 2       | O(n^(3/2))            |
| **Sedgewick's Sequence** | 4^k + 3Â·2^(kâˆ’1) + 1 | O(n^(4/3))            |

Example Code

```

int[] array = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};
sorter.sort(array, ShellSort.GapSequence.SEDGEWICK);

// Retrieve performance metrics
PerformanceTracker tracker = sorter.getTracker();
System.out.println("Comparisons: " + tracker.getComparisons());
System.out.println("Execution Time: " + tracker.getTimeNano() + " ns");
```

## Benchmark Output

After running the benchmark, a CSV file is generated with the following columns:

| Column           | Description                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `size`           | Input array size                            |
| `sequence`       | Gap sequence type (SHELL, KNUTH, SEDGEWICK) |
| `comparisons`    | Total comparisons                           |
| `swaps`          | Total swaps                                 |
| `array_accesses` | Array read/write operations                 |
| `time_nano`      | Execution time in nanoseconds               |

## Performance Metrics Tracked

* **Comparisons** â€“ Number of element comparisons
* **Swaps** â€“ Number of assignments or exchanges
* **Array Accesses** â€“ Total reads/writes to array elements
* **Execution Time** â€“ Nanosecond-precision timing

## Optimization Highlights

* Early termination when no swaps occur in a pass
* Precomputed gap sequences for better efficiency
* Comparative evaluation across multiple gap strategies
